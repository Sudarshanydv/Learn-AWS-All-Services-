📅 Day 21 | AWS Elastic Beanstalk — Platform as a Service (PaaS) in AWS 🌱☁️

Today, I learned about AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which is a fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) provided by AWS to deploy, manage, and scale applications automatically.

Elastic Beanstalk allows developers and DevOps engineers to focus only on application code, while AWS handles the infrastructure provisioning, scaling, load balancing, monitoring, and updates.

With Elastic Beanstalk, you can deploy applications quickly and reliably, making it a powerful service for DevOps workflows and cloud-native architectures.

# 🌱 AWS Elastic Beanstalk – DevOps Explanation

## What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?

**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** that helps you **deploy, manage, and scale applications automatically** without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

You just upload your **application code**, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles:

* EC2 instances
* Load Balancer
* Auto Scaling
* Monitoring
* Application updates

---

## Why DevOps Engineers Use Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk is useful when:

* You want **fast deployment**
* You don’t want to manage infrastructure manually
* You need **auto scaling + high availability**
* You want **CI/CD friendly deployments**

---

## Elastic Beanstalk Architecture (Behind the Scenes)

When you deploy an app, Elastic Beanstalk automatically creates:

* **EC2** – runs your application
* **Auto Scaling Group** – handles scaling
* **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)** – distributes traffic
* **Security Groups** – network security
* **CloudWatch** – logs & monitoring
* **S3** – stores application versions

> You control everything, but AWS manages it for you.

## How Elastic Beanstalk Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Create an Application

* Logical container for your app

### 2. Choose Platform

Supported platforms include:

* Java
* Python
* Node.js
* .NET
* PHP
* Docker

### 3. Upload Code

* ZIP file
* WAR file
* Docker image

### 4. Environment Created

* **Web Server Environment** (most common)
* **Worker Environment** (background jobs)

### 5. Application Runs

```
User → Load Balancer → EC2 Instances → Application
```

## Deployment Options in Elastic Beanstalk

Important for interviews:

* **All at Once** – Fastest, but downtime possible
* **Rolling** – Updates instances in batches
* **Rolling with Additional Batch** – Safer than rolling
* **Immutable** – Zero downtime, safest
* **Blue/Green Deployment** – Best practice for production

---

## Configuration Options

You can customize:

* Instance type
* Auto Scaling rules
* Environment variables
* Load balancer settings
* Health checks

Configuration methods:

* AWS Console
* AWS CLI
* `.ebextensions` (YAML configuration files)

---

## CI/CD with Elastic Beanstalk

Typical DevOps pipeline:

```
Git → Jenkins / GitHub Actions → Build → Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk
```

Features:

* Application versioning
* Rollback support
* Automated deployments

---

## Monitoring & Logs

* CloudWatch metrics
* Application logs
* Environment health dashboard (Green / Yellow / Red)

---

## Security in Elastic Beanstalk

* IAM roles & policies
* Security Groups
* VPC support
* SSL/TLS using ACM
* Environment-level isolation

---

## Advantages

* Easy to use
* Automatic scaling
* Built-in load balancing
* Supports multiple languages
* Reduced operational overhead

---

## Limitations

* Less control than raw EC2
* Not ideal for complex microservices
* Slightly higher cost than manual EC2 setup

---

## Interview One-Line Answer

> *AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS service that allows developers and DevOps engineers to deploy and manage applications without managing infrastructure. It automatically handles EC2, load balancing, auto scaling, monitoring, and supports multiple deployment strategies.*
